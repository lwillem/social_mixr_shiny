## Comparing mixing patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic (CoMix)

<br> 
The CoMix project is initiated to measure compliance to social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the impact on disease transmission. Monitoring the effectiveness of social distancing recommendations is of paramount importance to avoid further waves of COVID-19. The study started in March 2020, with surveys in the United Kingdom (UK), Belgium, and the Netherlands. In October 2020, the CoMix study was extended to another 17 European countries.


## CoMix Belgium
During the first two waves (April & May 2020) of the survey, the reduction in the average number of contacts was around 80% and this was quite consistent across all age-classes. The average number of contacts increased over time, particularly for the younger age classes, still remaining significantly lower than pre-pandemic values. For more info, please see:

## CoMix UK
The surveys in the UK population also showed that recorded contacts reduced dramatically compared to pre-pandemic levels (as measured in the POLYMOD study), with changes in reported contacts correlated with government interventions throughout the pandemic. Despite easing of restrictions in the summer of 2020, the mean number of reported contacts only returned to about half of that observed prepandemic at its highest recorded level.

## CoMix Netherlands
Findings suggest that the contact data collected in the CoMix survey can be useful in near real-time monitoring of the transmission potential, determining the effect of control measures that are aimed at contact reduction, describing determinants for contact behaviour, or serving as input for infectious disease models.
