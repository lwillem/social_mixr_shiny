## Comparing mixing patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic (CoMix)

<br> 
The CoMix project is initiated to measure compliance to social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the impact on disease transmission. Monitoring the effectiveness of social distancing recommendations is of paramount importance to avoid further waves of COVID-19. The study started in March 2020, with surveys in the United Kingdom (UK), Belgium, and the Netherlands. In October 2020, the CoMix study was extended to another 17 European countries.


## CoMix Belgium
During the first two waves (April & May 2020) of the survey, the reduction in the average number of contacts was around 80% and this was quite consistent across all age-classes. The average number of contacts increased over time, particularly for the younger age classes, still remaining significantly lower than pre-pandemic values. For more info, please see:
